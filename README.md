# Text Mining - Airbnb Unlisting Prediction

## Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to predict whether
a property listed on Airbnb will be unlisted in the next quarter1
. For this, you will resort to real
Airbnb property descriptions, Airbnb host descriptions, and comments from previous guests. In
summary, with the NLP techniques you will learn during the Text Mining course, you must
implement an NLP classification model able to predict, for each property, if it was unlisted (1)
or is still listed (0).
The project should be developed using Python and libraries such as NLTK, Scikit Learn, Keras
or PyTorch. Also, the project can be solved in various ways, which means there is no exact
correct solution. And, of course, groups should not use code from each other!
